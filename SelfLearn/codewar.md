1. Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

-------------------

2. It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

---------------------

3. Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.
The binary number returned should be a string.

Examples:

add_binary(1, 1) == "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)
add_binary(5, 9) == "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)

-----------------------

4. In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

------------------------------

5. Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.
